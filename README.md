# Hi. I build systems that make complexity behave. 👋

## 👾 About Me

I'm Tripp — a systems-minded programmer focused on **automation, verification, and compositional computation**.

For the last two decades, I’ve been doing one thing consistently:  
**finding the part of a problem everyone assumes must be painful — and making it boring instead.**

I don’t chase novelty for its own sake. I care about:
- deterministic behavior
- inspectable systems
- tools that explain themselves
- automation that gives people their time back

### A short origin story

In 2001, with almost no formal programming background, I taught myself just enough Perl and regex over a weekend to automate a task my team believed *couldn’t* be automated.  
What took hours suddenly took minutes.  
People got their days back.  
I was hooked.

That pattern never changed.

## 🧠 What I’m Working On Now

- **Verified compositional computation**  
  Systems where small, correct parts compose into larger systems with inherited correctness.

- **Deterministic message-passing architectures**  
  Computation as observable, replayable coordination — not opaque execution.

- **Learning as manufacturing**  
  Train → freeze → verify → deploy.  
  ML as an engineering discipline, not a guessing game.

If you like words like *deterministic*, *inspectable*, *replayable*, and *composable*, we’ll get along.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

| Category | Stack |
|--------|-------|
| 💻 Languages | Bash, Python, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Perl |
| 🧠 ML / Data | NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, fastai |
| 🗄️ Databases | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, AstraDB, Qdrant |
| 🔧 Infra | Docker, Linux, WSL |
| 🧰 Tooling | Git, VS Code, Jupyter |
| 🌐 APIs & Services | HuggingFace, OpenAI, AssemblyAI, Vast |

(I value **understanding systems** more than collecting frameworks.)

## 🧪 Projects

I’m currently consolidating and documenting several active research-grade projects.

> **More coming soon — this space will fill quickly.**

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on projects involving:
- systems architecture
- distributed computation
- verification
- automation
- unconventional ML approaches
- “this shouldn’t work, but it does”

If you’re building something thoughtful and a little weird, I’m listening.
