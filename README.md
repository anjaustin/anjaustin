# 👋 Greetings! I explore systems that settle into complexity. 🍃

## 👾 About Me

I'm Tripp — a systems-minded explorer focused on **automation, verification, and compositional computation**.

For the last two decades, I’ve been doing one thing consistently:  
**finding the part of a problem everyone assumes must be painful — and making it boring instead.**

I'm interested in:
- deterministic behavior
- inspectable systems
- tools that explain themselves
- automation that gives people their time back
- co-evolutionary systems
- cognition & recursive systems design

### True Story

In 2001, with almost no formal programming background, I taught myself just enough Perl and regex over a weekend to automate a task my team believed *couldn’t* be automated.  
Hours were compressed into seconds. My peers and I got our days back.  
I was hooked.

I love solutions!

## 🧠 What I’m Working On Now

- **Verified compositional computation**  
  Systems where small, correct parts compose into larger systems with inherited correctness.

- **Deterministic message-passing architectures**  
  Computation as observable, replayable coordination — not opaque execution.

- **Learning as manufacturing**  
  Train → freeze → verify → deploy.  
  ML as an engineering discipline, not a guessing game.

## 🧪 Projects

- **[TriX](https://github.com/anjaustin/trix)** — A 2-Bit Conditional Ternary Neural Architecture with Learned Computational Sparsity and Emergent Routing
- **[Fungible Computation](https://github.com/anjaustin/fungible-computation)** — Demonstrating Equivalence Between Neural and Classical Computation Through Exact Digital Emulation
- **[FLYNNCONCEIVABLE](https://github.com/anjaustin/flynnconceivable)** — Verified neural implementation of the 6502 CPU   
- **[Hollywood Squares OS](https://github.com/anjaustin/hollywood-squares-os)** — A distributed micro-kernel designed for addressable processor networks where message passing serves as the fundamental `syscall` interface.

> Focus: practical automation, leverage, clarity

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m interested in collaborating on projects involving:
- systems architecture
- distributed computation
- verification
- automation
- unconventional ML approaches
- “this shouldn’t work, but it does”

If you’re building something thoughtful and a little weird, I’m listening.
