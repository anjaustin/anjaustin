## EXPERIENCE

### Systems Prototyping, Research & Development

**Z Tangerine, Westminster, Colorado** — September 2019 : PRESENT

At Z Tangerine, I lead the development of first-in-series projects that solve business execution problems with process modeling and automation. I work with organizations in the Automotive, Communications, and Project Management industries to design, develop, and test prototypes for retail apps, back-end systems, and resource-dependent processes. Some noteworthy achievements include a project for an automotive client to model the full scope of their business processes. Through workshops, modeling simulations, and software prototyping I identified critical bottlenecks and high error loss rate processes, uncovering opportunities for streamlining operational workflows and significantly compressing time-to-revenue, sales cycle times, and customer support calls.
I also developed an extremely fast and lightweight messaging automation parser that revolutionized traditional workflows for a communications client by automating 95% of manual tasks and abstracting away 90% of operational complexity. More recently, I developed a prototype of a software tool that assesses the health and validity of major project plans against a set of industry best practices. My tenure at Z Tangerine has been marked by a passion for efficiency, simplicity, and the successful bridging of technical innovation and process management.
